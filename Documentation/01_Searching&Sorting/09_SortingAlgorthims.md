# Stable vs Unstable Algorithm

- does not disturb the order of matching value
- example \
  (2,7) (1,5) (1,4) (3,8) \
  Stable algorithm will maintain the order of (1,5) & (1,4)
  After Sorting - (1,5) (1,4) (2,7) (3,8)

## In place  Algorithm

- If we don't have to use extra space which is equal to the size of original dataset for sorting then its called not Inplace
- If the extra space is very negligible then its called inplace

## Merge Sort vs QuickSort

- Merge sort is stable
- Quick sort is in place
