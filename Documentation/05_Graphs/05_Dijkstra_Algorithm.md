# Implementing a graph

## Explanation

Dijkstra's algorithm is a popular algorithm used to find the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph. The graph must have non-negative edge weights.

Steps:

- Initialization:
  - Set the distance to the source vertex to 0 and the distance to all other vertices to infinity.
  - Create a priority queue (or min-heap) and insert the source vertex with a distance of 0.
  - Maintain a set of visited vertices to avoid reprocessing vertices.
- Main Loop:
  - While the priority queue is not empty:
  - Extract the vertex ùë¢ with the minimum distance from the priority queue.
  - Mark ùë¢  as visited.
  - For each neighbor ùë£ of ùë¢ :
    - If ùë£ has not been visited:
      - Calculate the alternative path distance through ùë¢ to ùë£ (i.e., ùëëùëñùë†ùë°ùëéùëõùëêùëí[ùë¢] + ùë§ùëíùëñùëî‚Ñéùë°(ùë¢,ùë£)).
      - If this alternative path distance is less than the current known distance to ùë£, update the distance to ùë£ and insert or update ùë£ in the priority queue with the new distance.
- Termination:
  - The algorithm terminates when the priority queue is empty, and the shortest path distances from the source to all vertices have been determined.

Properties:

- Time Complexity: The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is ùëÇ((ùëâ+ùê∏)log‚Å°ùëâ) when implemented with a priority queue (min-heap), where ùëâ is the number of vertices and ùê∏ is the number of edges.
- Space Complexity: The space complexity is ùëÇ(ùëâ)for storing the distances and the priority queue.

## Notes

> Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It uses a priority queue to always extend the shortest known path, ensuring optimal solutions.

### Pseudocode

```pseudocode

Procedure Dijkstra(graph, node)
Perform edge relaxation for all the outgoing edges from the starting node
  While Q is not empty
      Dequeue the first element from priority queue
      nextNode ‚Üê front element of queue after previous deque
      if nextNode is not null
        Relax the edges if necessary
      end if
   end while
end procedure


```
